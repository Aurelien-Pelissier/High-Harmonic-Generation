# High-Harmonic-Generation

High harmonic generation (HHG) refers to the process of creating vacuum or extreme ultraviolet
(VUV or XUV) light through a nonlinear interaction of an intense laser field with a gas target (figure). This repository contains the source code to calculate the high harmonics amplitude considering all involved physical phenomenons (Quantum mechanic,supersonic flow physics, Plasma physics and nonlinear optics).

## Involved parameters

 and adjusting the parameters such as driving field intensity, gas pressure or nozzle diameter to optimize the power output is not obvious.
