# High-Harmonic-Generation

High harmonic generation (HHG) refers to the process of creating vacuum or extreme ultraviolet
(VUV or XUV) light through a nonlinear interaction of an intense laser field with a gas target (figure). This repository contains the source code to calculate the high harmonics amplitude considering all involved physical phenomenons (Quantum mechanic,supersonic flow physics, Plasma physics and nonlinear optics).

 and adjusting the parameters such as driving field intensity, gas pressure or nozzle diameter to optimize the power output is not obvious.
