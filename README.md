# High-Harmonic-Generation
<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aurelien-Pelissier/High-Harmonic-Generation/master/report/HHG.png" width=200>
High harmonic generation (HHG) refers to the process of creating vacuum (VUV) or extreme (XUV) ultraviolet light through a nonlinear interaction of an intense laser field with a gas target. This repository contains the source code to calculate the high harmonics amplitude accounting for all involved physical phenomenons (Quantum mechanic, Supersonic flow physics, Plasma physics and Nonlinear optics). More specifically, we consider supersonic gas flow at the nozzle outlet, ions dynamic in the plasma, quantum atomic response of freed electrons, phase matching and absorption.
